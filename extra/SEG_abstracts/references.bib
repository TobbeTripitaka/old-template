  abstract = {The crustal structure of northern Africa is puzzling, large areas
	being of difficult access and concealed by the Sahara. The new global
	gravity models are of unprecedented precision and spatial resolution
	and offer a new possibility to reveal the structure of the lithosphere
	beneath the Sahara. The gravity gradients correlate better than gravity
	with geological features such as rifts, fold belts and magmatic deposits
	and intrusions. They are an ideal tool to follow geological units
	(e.g. basement units) below a stratigraphic layer of varying density
	(e.g. sediments). We focus on the Chad lineament, a 1300 km arcuate
	feature located between the west and central African rift system.
	The gravity fields show differences between the lineament and the
	west and central African rift system. Along the centre of the lineament
	high-density rocks must be present, which relate to either magmatic
	or metamorphic rocks. This is very different to the lineaments of
	the western and central-west African rift system which are filled
	with sediments. Considering present models of rifting and the absence
	of topography, the lineament cannot be coeval to the west and central
	African rift system and is most likely older. We suggest that the
	lineament is a structural element of the Saharan Metacraton.},

  title = {Optimized formulas for the gravitational field of a tesseroid},
  journal = {Journal of Geodesy},

  pages = {645--660},
  number = {7},
  month = jul,
  abstract = {Various tasks in geodesy, geophysics, and related geosciences require
	precise information on the impact of mass distributions on gravity
	field-related quantities, such as the gravitational potential and
	its partial derivatives. Using forward modeling based on Newton’s
	integral, mass distributions are generally decomposed into regular
	elementary bodies. In classical approaches, prisms or point mass
	approximations are mostly utilized. Considering the effect of the
	sphericity of the Earth, alternative mass modeling methods based
	on tesseroid bodies (spherical prisms) should be taken into account,
	particularly in regional and global applications. Expressions for
	the gravitational field of a point mass are relatively simple when
	formulated in Cartesian coordinates. In the case of integrating over
	a tesseroid volume bounded by geocentric spherical coordinates, it
	will be shown that it is also beneficial to represent the integral
	kernel in terms of Cartesian coordinates. This considerably simplifies
	the determination of the tesseroid’s potential derivatives in comparison
	with previously published methodologies that make use of integral
	kernels expressed in spherical coordinates. Based on this idea, optimized
	formulas for the gravitational potential of a homogeneous tesseroid
	and its derivatives up to second-order are elaborated in this paper.
	These new formulas do not suffer from the polar singularity of the
	spherical coordinate system and can, therefore, be evaluated for
	any position on the globe. Since integrals over tesseroid volumes
	cannot be solved analytically, the numerical evaluation is achieved
	by means of expanding the integral kernel in a Taylor series with
	fourth-order error in the spatial coordinates of the integration
	point. As the structure of the Cartesian integral kernel is substantially
	simplified, Taylor coefficients can be represented in a compact and
	computationally attractive form. Thus, the use of the optimized tesseroid
	formulas particularly benefits from a significant decrease in computation
	time by about 45 \% compared to previously used algorithms. In order
	to show the computational efficiency and to validate the mathematical
	derivations, the new tesseroid formulas are applied to two realistic
	numerical experiments and are compared to previously published tesseroid
	methods and the conventional prism approach.},
